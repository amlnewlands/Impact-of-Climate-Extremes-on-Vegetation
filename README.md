# Impact of Climate Extremes on Vegetation
This project was created for SIADS 592 Milestone 1 with a goal of demonstrating problem formulation, data acquisition, cleaning, manipulation, analysis, and visualization. It was built in collaboration with Linda Sylvester and Jacqueline Shulack. 

Phenology is the study of seasonal cycles in natural phenomena. Local environmental factors, such as temperature, sunlight, and precipitation often drive the timing of various events such as first bloom or first leaf. The trends and changes in this timing can be an indicator of climate change. Temperature in particular has been extensively studied as a contributor to earlier first leaf and first bloom dates. We would like to investigate how temperature and precipitation extremes, as indicated by values outside of normal ranges, impact the timing of these vegetative behaviors.

The raw phenophase data used has been included as the file "individual_phenometrics_data.csv" but originally comes from the following link: https://data.usanpn.org/observations

The cleaned climate index data used has been included as the file "climate.csv" but originally can be accessed from the following link: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/cei/graph
